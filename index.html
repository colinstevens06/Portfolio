        <h2>Who is Colin Stevens?</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a front-end web developer and storyteller whose experiences in web
          project management, journalism and customer service have shaped me
          into a detail-oriented, product-focused problem solver.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently enrolled in a full stack development bootcamp at Johns
          Hopkins University. So far in the bootcamp, I built upon my already
          strong foundation in HTML and CSS while learning the basics of
          JavaScript and JQuery, focusing all my projects on mobile-first
          designs.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to the bootcamp, I work full-time managing content and
          search engine optimization on a local hospital’s consumer-facing
          website. My time in this role has helped me learn about crafting a
          smooth user experience and how to develop content that ranks high in
          search engines. My degree and subsequent career in journalism,
          specifically working at a daily newspaper, shaped my ability to work
          in deadline-driven environments with a focus on detail. The
          combination of these experiences gave me a strong foundation for my
          future as a web developer and furthering my career in web marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I play drums in a cover band. Part of my band duties
          is promoting upcoming shows and managing our brand. You can see
          examples of my work on our Instagram account and on our website, which
          I designed.
