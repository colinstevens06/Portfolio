            <h2>Who is Colin Stevens?</h2>
            <p>
               I’m a front-end web developer and storyteller whose experiences
               in web project management, journalism and customer service have
               shaped me into a detail-oriented, product-focused problem solver.
            </p>

            <p>
               I am currently enrolled in a full stack development bootcamp at
               Johns Hopkins University. So far in the bootcamp, I built upon my
               strong foundation in HTML and CSS while learning the basics of
               JavaScript and JQuery, focusing all my projects on mobile-first
               designs.
            </p>

            <p>
               In addition to the bootcamp, I work full time managing content
               and search engine optimization on a local hospital’s
               consumer-facing website. My time in this role has helped me learn
               about crafting a smooth user experience and how to develop
               content that ranks high in search engines. My degree and
               subsequent career in journalism, specifically working at a daily
               newspaper, shaped my ability to work in deadline-driven
               environments with a focus on detail. The combination of these
               experiences gave me a strong foundation for my future as a web
               developer and furthering my career in web marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
               In my free time, I play drums in a cover band. Part of my band
               duties is promoting upcoming shows and managing our brand. You
               can see examples of my work on our Instagram account and on our
               website, which I designed.
            </p>
            <p>
               I also enjoy photography. I took the photos on this page -
               including the headshot, using a timer - and my photos can be
               viewed on my Instagram account.
